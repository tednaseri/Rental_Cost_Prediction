# rental_cost
<ul align="justify">
<li>It is a supervised machine learning project based on Kaggle Brazil Houses Dataset which is made of 10692 records and 14 features. Each row represents one home.</li>
<li>The goal is predicting rental cost of homes. Since the target feature is a numerical variable, it is a regression machine learning project where I minimized RMSE as the business metric.</li>
<li>This application includes data cleaning, data preparation, explanatory data analysis, and machine learning modeling.</li>
<li>For the machine learning purposes, linear regression, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models along with hyperparameter tuning are implemented.</li>
<li>By optimizing the XGBoost model as the best model, we could improve the business metric more than 9%.</li>
